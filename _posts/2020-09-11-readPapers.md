研究即是收集並分析訊息(資料)的系統化過程，旨在提升人們對所關注現象的理解水平。  
八大特色：起源自某個問題、需要明確的目標陳述、遵循特定的過程規劃、通常將主要問題拆分為更可控的子問題、  
由具體的研究問題或假設所指導、接受特定的關鍵假設、需要蒐集並解讀資料，嘗試借此解決先前所提出的問題、  
建立在先前已有的研究成果之上

# 論文閱讀指南

* 資料可從「教材」入手，直接看定義會比較難踏入
* 對文章進行總結
    * 為什麼要做這個研究(理論走向和目前缺陷)
    * 他們怎麼做這個研究(即他們的方法，還有與前人不同之處)
    * 發現了什麼(總結結果，補充和理論關係)
* 閱讀
    * 篩選
        * 標題、關鍵字、摘要、總結
    * 閱讀
        * 掃圖、表及其標註
        * 形成自己的批判
    * 精讀
        * 結果、討論、實驗
        * 忌從頭到尾精讀
    * 比記
        * 一句話總結每段文字

# How to read a paper in three pass
### First Pass: General idea  
> 10 min

#### How to?
* Read title, abstract, introduction
* Read headings (section, sub-section)
* Read conclusion
* Find the paper you've read in reference
#### Ask yourself
* Category: Application? improvement of an algorithm? concept?
* Theory: based-on other concept/system/theory?
* Correctness: Assumptions are valid?
* Contributions
* Clarity
### Second Pass: Grasp contents
> 1 hr

#### How to?
* Read figures, diagrams, graphs...
* Read to summarize it to others

**Ignore very detailed things such as proofs.**

#### If you still cannot understand...
* Put aside
* Read background materials and get back
* Go to the next pass

### The third pass: Re-implement virtually
> 4 to 5 hr (1 hr for experts)

#### How to?
* Read to be able to re-implement **virtually**
* Try to challenge everything
* Try to identify string/weak points

## Do a survey
1. Search (with good keyword) and read 3-5 papers with one pass  
(or if you are lucky, find a survey paper.)
2. Find shared citations, repeated author names, download them.  
These are key papers. They can also help you identify top conferences.
3. Grasp high-quality papers from these top conferences
4. Gather the papers collected from step 2 & 3.
5. Make two passes on these papers.

# How to review papers
* Make turns between papers from start to finish if you have time.
* Start as soon as possible. Mark them up. Make comments in the blanks.
* The purpose is to help select possible papers, not to judge on each paper.
## Structure of a review
1. Summarize the paper
2. State the contributions
3. Give specific comments
4. (If you like,) Summarize the good and bad points and a breif recommendation and its reasons

## Check list
* Purpose
    * What kind of conference is the paper for?
    * What are the audiences?
* Structure
    * Is related work missing?
* Novelty
    * What's new?
* Writing
    * Is it clear?
    * Is there any topy?
* Tenical flaws
* Gaps or unaddressed issues
* Is there anything you think is really cool?

## Tone
Remember your review will be read by people who don't know who you are, your personality or sense of humor is like, and can't see your face or hear your voice. Therefore, the tone is important.
 

* Convert negative comments to suggestions
    *  :thumbsdown: Negative comment: "This system doesn't ..."
    * :thumbsup: "The paper would be much stronger if it discusses..."

    * :thumbsdown: "This paper doesn't cite Multics, which did everything you do and more."
    * :thumbsup: "This paper reminded me of Multics, which seems quite similar. I would find the paper more persuative if it stated what the authors do over and above Multics."
* Criticize the paper, not the work itself.
* There is a remote possibility that you misunderstood the paper.
    * :thumbsdown: "The algorithm given breaks the rule."
    * :thumbsup: "The description in the paper left me worried that the algorithm breaks..."
* It's okay to be humorous, but try to stay emotionally mature.
